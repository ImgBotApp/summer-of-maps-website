## About the Azavea Summer of Maps program
Summer of Maps is a fellowship program and service for nonprofits organized by [Azavea](https://azavea.com). We are a [B Corporation](http://www.bcorporation.net/community/azavea) that applies geospatial technology, data analytics, and research for positive civic, social, and environmental impact.

As part of the Azavea Summer of Maps program, Geospatial Data Analysis Services Grants are awarded to nonprofits, who are matched with Fellows to complete high impact work that benefits the fellows, nonprofits, and the communities that the organizations serve.

Azavea Summer of Maps Fellows have completed nonprofit projects in a wide array of domains including:

- Arts & Culture
- Community & Economic Development
- Education
- Energy
- Environment & Ecosystems
- Food & Agriculture
- Health
- Elections & Civil Rights
- Transportation

## Program Timeline
Although Summer of Maps Fellows complete project work for 12 weeks during the summer, the program is a year-round operation.

Early in the year, the [Azavea Data Analytics Team](https://www.azavea.com/services/data-analytics/) reviews nonprofit project proposals and selects a shortlist of projects that meet data requirements, have challenging geospatial analysis and geographic visualization needs, and will contribute meaningful impact to the nonprofit organization and the communities they serve.

Then, student applicants submit their materials and candidates are interviewed. Qualified students are selected based on their skills and their desire to grow a career in geospatial data analysis. The top candidates are matched with challenging and meaningful projects and are awarded a paid fellowship position.

Starting in the summer, each Summer of Maps Fellow manages two different nonprofit projects. The fellows are paid a stipend for their work, in addition to the opportunity to learn from mentors and Azavea staff members.
