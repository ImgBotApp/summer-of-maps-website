## About Summer of Maps and Azavea
Summer of Maps is a fellowship program organized by <a href="https://azavea.com">Azavea</a>. We are a <a href="http://www.bcorporation.net/community/azavea">B Corporation</a> that specializes  in civic-minded GIS software development and spatial analysis.

Summer of Maps offers stipends to student GIS analysts to perform geospatial data analysis for non-profit organizations. Every year we match up non-profit organizations that have spatial analysis needs with talented students of GIS to implement projects over a three-month period during the summer.

### Organization Eligibility

The application is open to registered non-profit organizations registered as 501(c)3 with the IRS.  We will also consider international organizations that have a registered U.S. affiliate. We are looking for non-profit organizations with spatial analysis and geographic visualization needs.  Organizations are limited to two project submissions, but no more than one is likely to be funded.

The fellows will <b>work in our Philadelphia office</b> along with their mentors on two projects for <b>two different organizations</b>. A few examples of projects include the following:

- <b>Arts & Culture</b> – analyze geographic location of ticket sales and donations to both identify existing clusters and untapped markets
- <b>Community & Economic Development</b> – analyze housing needs to determine the best site for a new low income housing development
- <b>Elections & Civil Rights</b> – identify the sources of campaign contributions and measure the influence they have on the national political landscape
- <b>Environment, Sustainability & Ecosystems</b> – analyze the urban tree canopy and existing development to make a recommendation for future preservation
- <b>Public Health & Food</b> – develop three potential sites for a new soup kitchen and perform a market analysis to determine how each will affect existing sites
- <b>Public Safety</b> – analyze the impact of neighborhood indicators or other environmental factors on crime risk
- <b>Transportation</b> – identify the next 10 streets for the addition of bike lanes by scoring all street segments based on a variety of geographic criteria
