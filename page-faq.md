{:.faq #faq-1}
#### [#](#faq-1){:class="anchor-link" title="anchor link"} Do I need to move to Philadelphia or can I participate in this fellowship remotely?
Fellows are required to work at the Azavea office in Philadelphia during the program. Thus, we highly recommend moving to Philadelphia. There may be opportunities to do field work or travel, but this is project-based and not guaranteed.

{:.faq #faq-2}
#### [#](#faq-2){:class="anchor-link" title="anchor link"} Do I need to be a currently enrolled student?
Applicants must be enrolled at an accredited college or university as of April 1 in the year of the fellowship. For more information, see the eligibility page.

{:.faq #faq-3}
#### [#](#faq-3){:class="anchor-link" title="anchor link"} Do I need to be enrolled in a GIS program at my university?
You do not need to be enrolled in a GIS program. However, we do suggest a working knowledge of basic GIS concepts and some experience with ArcGIS software. It’s helpful if you’ve taken at least one class in GIS. That being said, the goal of the program to support future GIS Analysts, so we especially encourage students enrolled in GIS programs to apply.

{:.faq #faq-4}
#### [#](#faq-4){:class="anchor-link" title="anchor link"} Can I take time off during the fellowship?
Fellows are required to work at least 12 weeks over the course of the summer and must agree to the designated program start date. However, we understand summer is also the time for vacation and visiting family and friends. As long as the fellow meets the 12 week work requirement, it is permissible to take time-off during the summer, but this will extend your fellowship end date. Azavea is closed on July 4th.

{:.faq #faq-5}
#### [#](#faq-5){:class="anchor-link" title="anchor link"} How many projects can I work on?
Fellows typically work on two projects over the course of the summer. If there is extra time, there may be an opportunity to work on other projects. However, Azavea tries to arrange projects and schedules so there is little downtime and menial work not part of the project or program is never required.

{:.faq #faq-6}
#### [#](#faq-6){:class="anchor-link" title="anchor link"} What other learning opportunities will I be exposed to Azavea?
Over the course of the summer, fellows will be treated like any other staff with the opportunity to participate in our monthly brown bag lunches with guest speakers, technical staff meetings and design staff meetings. In addition, we anticipate hosting workshops hosted by staff or guests on topics such as GIS project management and web-mapping. Finally, Azavea has a fully stocked paper and digital library with books covering a wide-range of topics from computer programming to business management.

{:.faq #faq-7}
#### [#](#faq-7){:class="anchor-link" title="anchor link"} Can I receive credits at my university for work completed during the fellowship?
Azavea will coordinate with academic programs to approve academic credit. The fellow must receive permission from the college or university.

{:.faq #faq-8}
#### [#](#faq-8){:class="anchor-link" title="anchor link"} What benefits are included with the fellowship?
Fellows will receive reimbursement for public transportation expenses and biking to work. Unfortunately, we cannot offer paid sick leave or health insurance benefits. We like to consider the excellent learning opportunities at Azavea one of the most important benefits.

{:.faq #faq-9}
#### [#](#faq-9){:class="anchor-link" title="anchor link"} If I’m not accepted into the fellowship, can I be contacted by organizations that are looking for GIS work?
When filling out the application, you will have the opportunity to opt-in to allow your email to be shared with non-profits who may be interested in pursuing their projects if not selected by another student. We will never sell or share your email with any other third party, only non-profits with projects we have approved. In the past, we’ve had students ask for this because they were still interested in pursuing projects for school credit.
