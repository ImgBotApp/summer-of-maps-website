## About Summer of Maps
Summer of Maps is a 12-week program that provides competitive fellowships to students and matches them with challenging spatial analysis projects with nonprofit organizations.

The program has several objectives for students:
- Provide a high quality first professional experience for students with advanced geospatial analysis skills in order to prepare them to become the next generation of GIS professionals.
- Develop useful geospatial analysis deliverables that can be used to improve the operations of nonprofit organizations that would otherwise not be able to do so. 

Fellows are provided a $6,000 stipend and one-on-one mentoring by the Data Analytics team with support from other Azavea teams during the 12-week fellowship. The nonprofit organizations receive sophisticated analysis and visualization of their data. Each fellow works with two nonprofit organizations as part of the Summer of Maps team in Azavea’s Philadelphia office.

### Eligibility 
This is a paid fellowship program open to full-time or part-time students. The Summer of Maps program defines a student as an individual accepted into or enrolled in an accredited post-secondary institution located in the United States, including community colleges, undergraduate, masters, PhD and programs. Alternatively, applicants may be enrolled in an accredited non-U.S. university, but if they are a noncitizen, they must have a valid work visa that enables work in the United States (we are not able to sponsor students for a visa or provide travel expenses for travel to the U.S.). If students are accepted into or enrolled in a college or university program on April 15, 2017, they are eligible to participate in the program, even if they will graduate during the program or prior to it starting. Applicants must be available to work at the Azavea office in Philadelphia starting on Wednesday, June 1, 2017.

Applicants may be asked to provide transcripts or other documentation from their accredited institution as proof of enrollment or admission status. Applicants do not need to be in a Geography or GIS program in order to apply, but they should have experience performing analysis using desktop GIS software.

### Applying to the program
Applications for students open in February for the program beginning in June. Students apply online using the link on the Summer of Maps website. The application asks for information regarding their academic qualifications, detail their interest in the program and provide supporting information including a portfolio and resume. Most importantly, students review a list of the projects proposed by nonprofit organizations that have been preselected for that summer and discuss their interest in those projects.

A few qualities that help applications stand out are:
- Additional geospatial technical skills beyond ArcMap. For example, experience with web tools such as CARTO, Leaflet or MapBox; experience with open source tools like QGIS, GeoDa and R; or experience with SQL or Python.
- The inclusion of an online portfolio that highlights technical and cartographic capabilities of the applicant. (These are often shared via Google/Dropbox/S3 link or a web page).
- A demonstrated interest in learning new skills on their own (either through online courses or other resources).
- Interest from applicants in pursuing spatial analysis in the professional career. We think their experience as a Summer of Maps fellow will positively contribute to their success within the industry.

### General expectations
Students that accept the offer to participate in the program are expected to work for 12 weeks in Azavea’s Philadelphia office. Fellows are expected to adhere to a consistent weekly schedule. Responsibilities will include:
- Develop project requirements and a scope of work
- Research and assemble geospatial data from clients and public data sources
- Coordinate with mentors to provide regular status updates to their clients
- Develop map-based analyses
- Design cartography
- Write a minimum of two blog posts about the work
- Perform other data analysis and cartography tasks as directed by their mentor or the Data
Analytics Project Manager
- Participate in Azavea company activities
- Participate in kickoff and culminating program events
- Perform final presentations
- Prepare short presentations on projects for the culminating event
- Produce a final deliverable packages for each project including documentation, data, maps, a
report and other necessary client deliverables
- Complete all program work by the final day of the program (no exceptions)

### Compensation & time off
The fellowship is a full-time (minimum 40 hours per week) position available beginning Thursday, June 1 2017. Fellows are required to work 12 full weeks between June and August. Fellows will receive a stipend of $6,000. Because fellows will be working in the Azavea offices and using Azavea equipment, fellows will be considered statutory employees by the IRS. Fellows will therefore be paid as an Azavea employee, receiving a salary at the end of June, July, and August with social security and other payroll taxes deducted accordingly.

Fellows will be paid $2,000 each month. This is contingent upon working a minimum 40 hour work week and making progress on the two selected projects. If fellows are unable to complete the fellowship, they will forfeit a prorated portion of the stipend.

Fellows are eligible to take one paid sick day and will receive a pay holiday for Independence Day during
the duration of the program. Any additional sick days will extend the end date of the program. Fellows
that use public transit or a bicycle for commuting will be eligible for Azavea’s public transit or bicycle
benefit (up to $230/month for public transit and up to $15/month for bicycle expenses). 

Fellows are permitted to take up to one week of un-paid vacation. However, taking time off will extend
the fellowship based on the total number of vacation days. The program is unable to accommodate a
later or earlier start date or duration of less than 12 weeks total. Additionally, no vacation days may be
taken during the first two weeks of the program. 

### Division of work
The breakdown of work tasks are defined approximately:
- 40-50% Data Gathering, GIS Analysis & Map Production
- 15-20% Project Management (client communication, project set up)
- 15-20% Documentation and Writing
- 10-15% Research & Learning
- 5% Office Meetings and Activities

### Timeline
Applications for students open in February and remain open for three weeks. In March, after the submission due date has passed; the Summer of Maps team will review applications and select about 12 finalists to interview. Interviews will be conducted via Google Hangout, Skype, or phone.

A homework assignment will be provided and reviewed to make a final decision. Fellows will be selected and invited to the program in early April. Fellows will have 3 business days to accept or decline the fellowship. Once all acceptances are official, a public announcement will be made.

The program begins the first week in June and extends twelve weeks.
