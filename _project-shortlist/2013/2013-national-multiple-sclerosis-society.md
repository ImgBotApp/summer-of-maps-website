## Spatial Analysis Project:
Develop a map to visually identify MS prevalence and chapter services/programs delivered by county. Utilize "heat map" to show pockets of adult disability, overlayed with registered MS patients and MS prevalance. Use different maps to clearly display the below:
- MS prevalence by population
- MS prevalence by county
- Patient services delivered overlayed with registered MS patients
- Programs/Outreach events held overlayed with registered MS patients
- Disabled population compared with MS prevalence
- Legislative pockets showing high rates of disability and MS
- Median/mean household income by zip code

Student is encouraged to propose further analysis of the data (see How maps and reports will be
used).

#### Data available:
- US Census Bureau population and disability census data; household income
- Registered MS patients
- Zip analysis for MS patients utilizing chapter services
- Zip analysis for MS patients attending programs/outreach days
- Locations of programs, outreach days, self-help groups
- People signed up for advocacy alerts (chapter, state, federal)

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
- MS prevalence by population – report
- MS prevalence by county – map
- Patient services delivered overlayed with registered MS patients – map
- Programs/Outreach events held overlayed with registered MS patients – map
- Disabled population compared with MS prevalence - report/map
- Legislative pockets showing high rates of disability and MS - map/report
- Median/mean household income by zip code (overlayed with MS prevalence) – map

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
This could be a national, regional or state project. Our chapter has direct access and data for PA and NJ and can easily obtain DE data. Depending on the interest and scope students would like to pursue, we can either scale-up or scale-down this project. All scopes will enable Society staff to:
- Identify gaps in MS patient services delivered - prepare plan to fill the void
- Identify geographic areas with high numbers of MS patients in which community programming is needed - plot programs in said areas
- Determine whether there are disparities between local population/disability rates and MS prevalence - create community outreach efforts to identify and register more MS patients in those areas
- Determine clusters of disability and MS in communities which will drive legislative efforts
