## Spatial Analysis Project:
We developed and implemented a community-level HIV prevention intervention for young Black and white men who have sex with men (MSM). To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, we collected data from panels of young MSM in Philadelphia and Baltimore. We would like to map the location of residences of study participants and compare the characteristics of their neighborhoods.

#### Data available:
We have data from four waves of interviews with 300 MSM in Philadelphia and Baltimore, including home addresses. We will also access census tract characteristics, including median income, educational attainment and racial distribution, as well as vital statistics data on neighborhood health characteristics.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
We want to create maps of study participant residences to assess how well we were able to recruit from all areas of the cities. Reports will include a description and comparison of neighborhood characteristics of Black and White MSM in Philadelphia and Baltimore.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The maps and reports will be used to assess the effectiveness of the intervention in different types of neighborhoods. In addition, we will be able to include neighborhood variables in statistical models testing intervention effectiveness.
