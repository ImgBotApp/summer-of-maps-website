## Spatial Analysis Project:
Political geography is a long and complex problem with no easy solution, largely caused by the lack of uniformity and bottom up election administration systems. These problems rarely allow people and groups, outside of major media companies and corporations, the capacity to represent districts and results in a visual capacity except for narrow and city and specific state based graphics. Creating an open dataset for the entire US based on electoral districts and precincts (if possible).

#### Data available:
We have full street table data tied to precincts for the entire US, as well as all statewide district data and a large set of sub-county level electoral district data (school board districts, judicial districts, etc.). We also have contacts with many state and county governments and could obtain GIS data for locations that have made that shift, such as Utah, Wisconsin, LA County, and Maricopa County.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
We would like a generation of full mapping data for a number of states representing electoral districts at a sub-federal level. If possible, a conversion of street table data into precinct and precinct split level GIS data would allow improved polling location mapping for public use.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
Maps and reports would be released openly, but the district representations would be tied to candidate information for upcoming elections and would be used to display election result and polling location information. All data produced by our organization that would be collected (the results/candidate/polling location data) would also be released openly so that others would have access to this entire dataset.
