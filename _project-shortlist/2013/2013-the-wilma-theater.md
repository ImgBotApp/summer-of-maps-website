## Spatial Analysis Project:
Using the extensive constituent records database, develop maps of density and distribution of current and lapsed subscribers, single-ticket buyers and donors. Analyze the distribution against overall demographic data, racial and ethnic grouping, income averages and education.

#### Data available:
Existing constituent records of current and past ticket buyers, subscribers, donors, and other patrons, recorded in our Tessitura database. The Wilma currently maintains over 111,500 active constituent records; over 99,000 of those records are for individual constituents, and over 94,000 have contact information.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
Reports that illustrate the location and density of Wilma subscribers, single-ticket buyers, and donors, as well as the overlap among these categories, over the past few seasons; ideally, these reports would also set this geographic data alongside overall demographic data about racial and ethnic makeup, average levels of education and income, and education, in order to provide a composite picture of our current constituency, as well as to identify markets with similar characteristics in the region.

In addition, by using an earlier Azavea report mapping Wilma patrons from 2001 â€“ 2005, we would hope to be able to track any changes in the core Wilma constituency over the past decade, as subscription and single-ticket buying habits have changed significantly during that period.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The primary goal for this project is to gain an accurate composite picture of our constituency; this will help us to target marketing efforts to our existing constituency, to identify other areas with compatible demographics, and to better tailor development efforts and cultivation events to serve specific communities of donors.

Beyond refining existing marketing and development efforts, though, these reports will provide a valuable source of data in understanding our constituency as the Wilma examines alternate models for programming and season planning, helping to ensure that we satisfy our subscriber and donor base even as we change our audience engagement models to better support our artistic mission.
