## Spatial Analysis Project:
Federation would like to study the need for transportation services in our community. Specifically, we would like to understand the need for transportation as it relates to age, and frailty of clients. We would like to understand how mobility challenges vary with income. We would like to display visually where the elderly and frail reside, as well as where lower income groups reside. As part of this analysis, we would want to understand where in our community are the greatest gaps in transportation, as well as what other resources are available for
transportation.

If possible, we would like to map this data with an overlay of where recent PHMC studies have indicated potential clients with the greatest need for transportation services live, and for what purpose transportation is needed: individual medical appointments, group trips to grocery stores, etc.

We would also like to be able to view projected changes in residences of the seniors in our community. Currently, a very large proportion of the poor Jewish and non-Jewish elderly that we serve live in northeast Philadelphia, along City Line Avenue, Eastern Montgomery County, Delaware County, and in parts of Center City Philadelphia. We would like to map the residential areas where poor seniors reside now and do a comparison map of projections over the next 10 years, if possible. This will help us determine where to locate services in the future.

#### Data available:
2009 Jewish Population Study which includes demographic data on the Jewish population. Demographic data on those we now serve, including the current senior population. Data includes geographic origin, age, income, and frailty analysis of current clients

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
- Where the elderly live
- Where poor elderly live
- Age breakdown of the elderly
- Frailty analysis
- Income analysis
- Correlation among the above factors
- Any information on projected shifts of where the elderly live
- Areas with no public transportation systems
- Areas with existing transportation systems
- Why transportation is needed -- shopping, medical appointments, etc.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
Staff will use the maps and reports to make recommendations of the types of services we should develop. The maps and reports will be disseminated to committees that make funding decisions. We will distribute through reports to them and as well as make oral presentations to our boards. The information will also be included in fund raising packets for meetings with donors. It is possible that the information will also be included in our organization's website, in summary forms, and the Jewish Exponent to make our community aware of the extent of need. We are happy to share the data with other organizations that request it.
