## Spatial Analysis Project:
CCD/CPDC proposes a thorough real estate and demographic analysis of all of Philadelphia’s elementary school catchment areas between Girard Avenue and Tasker Street, river to river, potentially including but not limited to:
- Mapping of all of Philadelphia’s primary schools, including public, private, parochial, magnet, and charter schools by category within their respective catchments
- Total value of all real estate sorted by Office of Property Assessment (OPA) categories and broken out by catchment area
- Average sale price of single family homes, multifamily properties, and commercial real estate in the catchment
- Real estate sales transactions, including number of units, average days on market, and average sale price by catchment
- Total number of building permits for new construction and major rehabilitations by catchment
- Average household income by catchment
- Owner/renter balance by catchment
- Number of families with children under 18 by catchment
- Number of children born to families in the past 5 years by catchment
- School enrollment levels, including number of children from the catchment and number of children commuting to the school from outside the catchment (including the home location of children commuting from outside the catchment)
- Percentage low income by school
- PSSA score data by school
- Special programs and extracurricular activities by school

#### Data available:
Datasets that can be used for this analysis are largely publicly available. Where datasets are not publicly available, CCD/CPDC will leverage relationships with appropriate contacts to obtain data. Datasets useful to this project include:
- OPA data, accessible via Open Data Philly
- School District of Philadelphia data, accessible via Open Data Philly
- Trend Multiple Listing Services data, accessible via real estate brokers
- Building permits data, accessible via License to Inspect
- American Community Survey data, accessible via American FactFinder
- Births data, accessible via the Philadelphia Department of Public Health

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
- Preliminary analysis of the impact of public school quality on 2014 real estate values (property assessments and sales) within their catchments
- Maps demonstrating the locations from which students commute to access individual schools
- Demographic profile of families living within each school catchment with projections of school-aged children by year
- ArcGIS MXDs, including all data layers, for future research

We are open to the creative presentation of these materials by the fellow.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
These maps and reports will be used to inform the CCD/CPDC long-term young family retention strategy; will be shared with relevant contacts at the School District of Philadelphia (SDP), Greater Center City Neighborhood School Coalition, Philadelphia City Council, and business community stakeholders; and will be used when applying for public, foundation, or private funding to support schools within the Greater Center City Neighborhood School Coalition area.
