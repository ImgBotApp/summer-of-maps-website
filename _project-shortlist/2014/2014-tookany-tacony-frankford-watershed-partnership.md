## Spatial Analysis Project:
Green Infrastructure could save our rivers from degradation each time it rains. But to install these systems, it helps to obtain community and policymaker buy-in. Research has shown that green spaces are an amenity with many social benefits to people who use them. Green Infrastructure, specifically Green Stormwater Infrastructure, or GSI, have benefits that are twofold. GSI functions to manage stormwater runoff onsite and as a shared green community space. If the public is aware of these benefits, justification for installation of GSI becomes easier.

The fellow would help us to identify areas for possible installations of Green Infrastructure that would have the most community benefit in order to maximize value per installation dollar. We would identify these communities based on their demographic and income status, proximity to existing green space and educational opportunities (schools, recreation centers, etc).

This study first seeks to identify areas that would meet the requirements for the installation of Green Stormwater Infrastructure, and secondly, their community benefits to areas of need. GSI is not only a stormwater management tool, but adds green space and science and engineering educational opportunities to the schools and neighborhoods.

After identifying these communities, we would then overlay the environmental data: Would the GSI installation be in the combined sewer area? Close to Tacony Creek Park and its outfalls? Continuous impervious? Sewer inlet? Gradient?

This is a very precise request, and data could become normalized based on a more concise study: e.g. Green Infrastructure Educational Opportunities in TTF Watershed (possible installation areas and their proximity to schools).

#### Data available:
- Scattergood Foundation Demographic/Open Space Data around Tacony Creek Park
- Opendataphilly.com
- TTF Integrated Watershed Management Plan â€“ (also mentions dam removal- something to consider for this project as well)
- Watershed-wide Demographic information (incomes, crime, poverty, obesity,)
- Sewage Outfalls in Tacony Creek Park
- Combined Sewer Area
- Impervious Area Data
- Sewer Inlet Data
- Contour Data (2 foot available)

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
- Map of the watershed and green stormwater infrastructure(GSI)/stormwater management Practices
- Map of watershed demographics
- Map of generalized areas suitable for stormwater management practices around Tacony Creek Park
- Parcel or neighborhood based thematic maps correlating to promixity to GSI
- Statistics of population within proximity to GSI and educational statistics of the neighborhood
- Report on findings; conclusion, recommendations for areas to incorporate GSI, and additional data to be compiled for improved study.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The maps will be used to identify areas that would most benefit from stormwater management practices for community development or educational outreach. It would also give a possible overview of areas suitable for GSI, or at least identify areas not able to incorporate stormwater management because of some physical or anthropogenic feature.
