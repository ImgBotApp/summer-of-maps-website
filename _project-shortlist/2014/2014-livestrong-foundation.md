## Spatial Analysis Project:
Austin is one of the largest cities in the country without a comprehensive cancer center. In a recent report sponsored by the LIVESTRONG Foundation, one of the major issues facing cancer patients is the fragmented delivery of care. A cancer patient is likely to receive surgery, radiation and chemotherapy all in different locations – and support for non-clinical needs (e.g. addressing insurance issues, coping with emotion concerns) in many locations. This is especially taxing on those who live outside of the Austin city limits. The hospital serving the “Austin” clients actually serves a 9 county area spread out over hundreds of miles. And, there is limited public transportation to support patients getting from one place to another. This project will analyze the current distribution of cancer patients in the great Austin area, the location where patients receive clinical and non-clinical care and the existing and planned infrastructure for public transportation.

#### Data available:
- Texas Cancer Registry (TCR): The freely available TCR captures information related to cancer diagnosis by location.
- Capital Metro: Capital Metro is the local provider of all public transportation. Their existing lines for rail and buses as well as their planned expansion are all publicly available.
- Health Center Guide and Recent Report from LIVESTRONG: The Austin Business Journal recently released a report that indicates where all cancer patients are receiving support. This is not digitized, but the data are all available. Additionally, the recent report that was supported by LIVESTRONG includes information about where care is being delivered.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
We expect to have a map and related report that will make clear where lines of travel are for cancer patients, areas where public transit can be supporting travel for patients, and areas where there is a significant lack of support. Additionally, recommendations for potential other options for travel for cancer patients would be included in the report.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
Currently, the University of Texas at Austin is building the infrastructure to open a medical school in 2016. Consideration is also being given at this time for developing a cancer program. Understanding the issues facing cancer patients now would help to identify issues that the Foundation could work on to help address the complex system of navigation as well as identify issues that could be solved with a cancer program over the long term.
