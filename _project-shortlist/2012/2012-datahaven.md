## Spatial Analysis Project:
We have geocoded data sets on many different things - crime, foreclosures, parks, community investments, scholarship recipients, student achievement, block-level health and quality of life survey data, etc. It would be interesting to analyze some of the associations between these measures at a block level and also figure out the best ways to map such data. For example, are elementary school students more likely to achieve in school, or be healthy, when they live in a more stable neighborhood? Are black teenagers more likely to live on a block with foreclosures? How much more likely?

#### Data available:
See question above. In addition to the above list, we have downloaded block-level Census and American Community Survey data that could be helpful. We like to work with Census LED (employer-household dynamics) data as well, which we have not downloaded into a database but which we often use on the OnTheMap application.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
We regularly work with geospatial analysts on the above issues. We are looking for someone very creative who can help us do more than the standard tables and maps that display block level incident rates. Creating infographics, or more complicated geospatial analyses (e.g., based on point level data rather than data aggregated to a block) is what we are looking to achieve. These will help communicate various issues in New Haven to the general public.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
These analyses can be used to support our community projects, including a report for the NAACP, a community indicators report on the entire region, and various public health analyses. These reports will be published in the Fall of 2012 to a wide audience and we would be happy to cite your volunteer's work on anything we publish.
