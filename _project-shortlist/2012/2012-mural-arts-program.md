## Spatial Analysis Project:
- analyze geographic location of people who attend community meetings, paint days and other events related to mural projects and art education sites
- analyze geographic location of students in our program to identify how many come from high crime police districts or areas that are heavily served by the Department of Human Services (a major funder) to help us determine potential areas for new sites.

#### Data available:
- Sign in sheets providing participant addresses at public/community events
- Students applications with addresses and zip codes
- map/list of high crime police district zip codes
- map of concentration of DHS services in Philadelphia

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
- concentration/geographic location of people who attend community meetings, paint days and other events related to mural projects and art education sites
- concentration/geographic location of students in our program in relation to high crime police districts or areas that are heavily served by the Department of Human Services

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
- identify areas where more outreach is needed to get participants for events
- help us determine potential areas for new art education sites/target populations
- report % of students who live in high crime police districts or areas that are heavily served by the Department of Human Services for our funders/grant applications
- develop strategies to recruit students from underserved areas
