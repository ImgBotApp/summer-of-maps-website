## Spatial Analysis Project:
The WSO has identified geographic expansion as a primary vehicle by which to increase the size of its audience, donor and corporate sponsor base. Our spatial analysis project will have two components: 1.) To fully analyze our existing constituencies in regard to demographic makeup and transactional habits. 2.) Analyze the surrounding communities to determine which of them are most capable of providing similar constituencies to support WSO concerts, special events and education programs.

#### Data available:
Data sets in hand include transactional histories for existing ticket buyers, donors and corporate sponsors, as well as demographic data for ticket buyers and donors, dating from 2005 to date. Transactional data includes all information relevant to ticket purchases, season subscriptions, individual donations, concert and event sponsorships (date, amount, number of tickets, type of concert seating, type of concert or event sponsored, etc.).

Additional data sets include general demographic information for Waterbury and the surrounding suburban communities, (population, household makeup, income, education, age, ethnicity, etc.).

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
This project will provide us with statistical and visual representations of the above referenced data sets as well as geographical representation of potential communities most likely to provide success for the WSO.
Reports:
- Profiles of existing WSO constituencies in regard to location, income, age, etc. (classical concert single ticket buyers vs. pops concert single ticket buyers; subscription buyers vs. donors, sponsors vs. special event attendees, etc.)

Maps:
- Financial and demographic analysis of existing constituencies in each specific community of Waterbury and the surrounding towns.
- Demographic representation of suburban communities currently under-involved with the WSO.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The project outputs will directly influence our marketing strategy of existing and future WSO products, as well as provide clear identification of which communities are most appropriate for geographic expansion.
