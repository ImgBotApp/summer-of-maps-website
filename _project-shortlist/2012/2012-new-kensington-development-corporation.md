## Spatial Analysis Project:
The spatial analysis project will identify the effectiveness of the Sustainable 19125 initiative (see: www.sustainable19125.org). The program’s goal is to make 19125 the most sustainable zip code in the city. This initiative has already been identified by NeighborWorks America as a model for developing local leadership capacity to green communities. Now completing its 3rd year, NKCDC would like to be able to analyze its impact so that appropriate decision making can occur to create a more effective program and share information with local and national partners.

#### Data available:
NKCDC has over 100 data sets that have been collected for the neighborhood and are linked to parcel shape files. These include but are not limited to vacancy, tree coverage, façade condition, green actions, neighborhood leaders, etc. Supplementary data is available through:
- Current data identifying green actions linked to individual addresses (excel), 2012
- U.S. Census Bureau
- Temple University analysis on baseline green actions, 2010
- NKCDC Success Measures Resident Quality of Life Survey, 2010
- Cartographic Modeling Lab University of Pennsylvania Neighborhood Information System
- Police District Crime Statistics
- TRF Mapping Access
- Sustainable19125.org mapping tool

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
1. Mapping of all collected green action data and analysis on whether there is a linkage between trained leaders and green neighborhood actions.
2. Mapping of vacancy rates, and other indicators within commercial corridors over time.
3. Mapping of baseline data for new green community. Identification of additional data collection strategies which will serve to inform this spatial analysis over time.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The maps will be used to identify impact, inform and steer programmatic direction, identify impact, and
serve as a reporting and fundraising tool.
