## Spatial Analysis Project:
National Parks Conservation Association’s (NPCA) mission is to protect and enhance America’s National Parks for present and future generations. A particular focus of NPCA’s Grand Teton Field office is to work to protect wildlife and their migration corridors. Concerns have been raised by NPCA members and the local community in Teton County, WY regarding existing fencing within Grand Teton National Park. NPCA would like to better understand the perceived problems with existing fences in Grand Teton National Park and whether conflicts exist for wildlife.

#### Data available:
The GIS data includes shape files for four attribute layers covering Grand Teton National Park that will be necessary to support the project. These include:
1. Fence shape files
2. Land ownership shape files
3. Topographic terrain shape files
4. Vegetation cover shape files

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
There will be several maps created in order for NPCA to complete a fence assessment. There will be initial maps created to be used for field work. Once the field work is completed, the field observations on current conditions need to be incorporated into final maps for analysis and NPCA’s assessment report. This assessment will enable NPCA to understand the areas where improvements can be made, and identify existing wildlife friendly fences that do not need improvements.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The maps will allow NPCA to understand the current status and extent of fences in Grand Teton National Park that may affect wildlife movements within the park and between the park and adjacent lands. NPCA will complete field work on accessible fences to assess their type, condition, height and potential hazards or barriers to wildlife. Of particular interest are fences that are in known movement corridors for ungulates.

NPCA will also incorporate available information on past fence removals in the park and assess what has been done well in fence design, such as current wildlife crossings and fences that meet wildlife friendly specifications. The report will acknowledge historic and present land uses and management needs for fences, such as ranch in-holdings and seasonal horse pastures.

This fencing assessment will enable NPCA to offer specific critique of potential problem fences and make recommendations to Grand Teton National Park for design modifications that will serve both resource management needs and reduce or remove conflicts with wildlife.
