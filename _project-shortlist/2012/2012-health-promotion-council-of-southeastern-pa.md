## Spatial Analysis Project:
HPC proposes to utilize the Summer of Maps Program to strategically identify geographic locations to expand the organization’s Cultivating Community Campaign (CCC). The CCC is a food access initiative within Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, that seeks to increase the supply of and access to fresh produce for low-income individuals and families in the Greater North Penn region of Montgomery County. Spatial analysis would include population data (specifically, income/poverty, density, and food access/insecurity data), food access points (including both nonprofit/food pantry and retail food locations), farm land, and current and prospective project partners. HPC, community partners and local funders will be able to utilize the analysis to strategically expand the network of fresh food access points for low-income individuals and families in the region, and more strategically link partners to maximize efficiency within the system.

#### Data available:
- Public Health Management Corporation, Household Health Survey Database, specifically data related to quality of local groceries, access to transportation.
- US Census Population Data (particularly income data)
- Free/Reduced School Meal Eligibility (North Penn, Souderton Area, and Wissahickon School Districts)
- Food Pantry and Soup Kitchen locations (Montgomery County)
- Farmer’s Market locations (Montgomery County)
- Land use maps (from Montgomery County Planning Commission)
- CCC community and school garden sites
- CCC food distribution sites
- Location of prospective partners, i.e., farmers

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
The spatial analysis work would generate a map that identifies areas where intersections of low-income populations and food insecurity exists. The map will also identify prospective CCC partners (i.e., farmers, organizations to start community garden sites, etc.) near these intersections of poverty and food insecurity. Spatial analysis would overlay this population data to identify current traditional points of food access serving low income populations (i.e., food pantries, soup kitchens), current underserved areas and potential opportunities for strengthening the network of food access points.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
Maps and analysis will be used for project planning purposes. Currently, HPC leads the CCC, which seeks to increase access to fresh, local produce for families and individuals in need within the Greater North Penn region of Montgomery County. The CCC seeks to increase the supply of and access to fresh produce for low-income individuals and families by creating or expanding small-scale edible gardens and by accessing farm fresh produce that will not be sold, and linking those fresh produce sources with organizations that maintain traditional (food pantries, soup kitchens) and non-traditional (back-pack programs, share tables, and congregate meals) food distribution mechanisms. The analysis and integration of data into easy-to-read maps and reports will support the CCC in its efforts to be more strategic and proactive in targeting partners in geographic locations with high levels of poverty and food insecurity, and limited access to fresh produce, in order to more efficiently provide fresh food access in areas with the greatest need.
