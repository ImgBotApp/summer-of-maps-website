## Spatial Analysis Project:
The City of Philadelphia’s 2015 Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan sought to increase bicycle mode share from 1.6% to 6.5% by 2020. With mode share currently estimated to be 2.2%, it is clear that the City is not on track to meet this goal. The Bicycle Coalition believes that creating a bicycle travel demand model to identify areas where new or improved infrastructure could best lead to growth in bicycle mode share is a critical next step in achieving 6.5% mode share.

The Bicycle Coalition has proposed a “Hub and Spoke” network of high quality bicycle infrastructure which we believe is needed to triple mode share.  At the same time, the City of Philadelphia has planned both to build 30 miles of protected bike lanes and improve its existing bicycle lane network. To date, neither of these proposals have been validated, necessitating the development of a bicycle travel demand model.

#### Data available:
- Commute mode by Census Block (US Census, American Community Survey)
- Existing bicycle infrastructure (City of Philadelphia)
- DVRPC bicycle counts (24 hour counts, seasonally adjusted)
- Bicycle Coalition bicycle counts (rush hour, fall commute)
- DVRPC vehicular traffic counts
- CCD vehicular and bicycle counts traffic counts
- DVRPC bicycle level of stress map and connectivity
- Commercial and residential density proxies (land use & building height)
- SEPTA transit stops and routes
- Vision Zero High Injury Network (City of Philadelphia)
- Bicycle Crashes (PennDOT)

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
Bicycle travel demand model based upon:
- Existing commute mode share
- Existing bicycle travel volumes
- Vehicular travel volumes
- Philadelphia’s High Injury Network
- Existing bicycle infrastructure & level of stress and connectivity
- Transit access
- Commercial and residential densities

Report outlining bicycle infrastructure improvements needed to increase commute mode share to 6.5%, prioritized by forecast demand.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The travel demand model and report on infrastructure improvements needed to reach 6.5% mode share will be used to inform governmental agencies (Office of Transportation and Infrastructure Systems, Streets Department, Finance & Budget Department, and the Philadelphia City Planning Commission), Business Improvement Districts  such as Center City District or University City District), City Council, and the region’s Metropolitan Planning Organization, the Delaware Valley Regional Planning Commission about where bicycle infrastructure investment is needed to accelerate the growth in bicycle commuting mode share.

Ultimately, deliverables will be used in the Bicycle Coalition’s advocacy efforts to make bicycling a safe and fun way for anyone to get around Philadelphia.
