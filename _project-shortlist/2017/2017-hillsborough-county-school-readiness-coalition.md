## Spatial Analysis Project:
The Early Learning Coalition of Hillsborough County proposed project is to utilize spatial analysis to analyze the efficiency and services available in the system of care for young children and to develop strategies that will lead to an increase in the percentage of young children ready to enter kindergarten. ELCHC's project will use spatial analysis to help understand the supply of childcare options available for families in Hillsborough County Florida in relation to population of families with young children integrating both home and work addresses. In addition, we will layer community demographics, connections to elementary schools, quality ratings for child care providers, kindergarten readiness scores, and other early care and education supports available to families into the analysis.

#### Data available:
We have the following datasets:
- basic Hillsborough County demographics available through the census
- addresses of early care and education locations
- elementary school addresses
- kindergarten readiness rates per school
- quality measure for child care providers and addresses
- school boundary areas
- major employers and addresses
- public transportation routes
- data regarding reports child abuse and neglect
- County/City crime data

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
Maps that show relationships among early care and education providers and supports in relation to population (including demographics such as income, dual language learners), present school readiness score at elementary schools, school boundary areas, disbursement of quality child care services, rates of child abuse and neglect, crime, access to public transportation, and major employers. Statistics and resulting reports that link data from maps and data to our desired outcomes. Reports with identification and analysis of best practice sites/communities relative to school readiness and reports that would suggest solutions to communities with substantial deficits.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
ELCHC will work with our community partners including Hillsborough County Public Schools, Department of Children and Families, Work Force Alliance, Head Start, City of Tampa, Hillsborough County, United Way Suncoast, Community Foundation of Tampa Bay, Children's Board of Hillsborough County, Chamber of Commerce, and other local funders to develop a strategic plan for the County to systematically improve the early care and education system of care to increase the rates school readiness across the County.
