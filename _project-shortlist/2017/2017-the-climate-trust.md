## Spatial Analysis Project:
The analysis will identify and map forestlands that have high potential to sequester and store carbon over the near-term (ten years), where landowners are uniquely situated to value carbon over timber revenue. Multiple constraints like distance to export and domestic log markets, high operations costs, low species value, soil productivity, and FIA data, will be considered. The initial analysis will identify forestlands at or below regional baseline values (average initial carbon stocks) but are well-suited to generate offsets over the near-term. This map will expand on and update currently outdated resources, like the Woods Hole Research Center National Biomass & Carbon Dataset created in 2000. The second analysis will identify the economic factors that are likely result in new carbon market participants. This aspect of the project is unique because it will illustrate those regions that are better suited for payments to sequester carbon rather than traditional harvesting operations.

#### Data available:
The datasets we have on hand at the time of application are limited, but our GIS staff will assemble the following if selected:
- spatial biomass estimates
- forest inventory data from US Forest Service FIA program
- soil types and productivity from NRCS SSURGO database
- aerial and satellite imagery
- topography
- land use and land use change from USGS landcover database

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
First, we hope to create a nation-wide map showing biomass stocks as they compare to the California Air Resources Board's assessment of carbon stocks. ARB has developed an assessment dataset that stratifies carbon stocks by ecoregion, then site class, then forest type. This is a fairly general classification and can be refined down to the county level using Forest Service Inventory and Analysis Program datasets. If time and resources allow, a second layer of maps would account for economic constraints such as distance to market or manufacturing facilities, relative value of native species, and other economic constraints that will make managing for carbon sequestration and conservation more competitive than traditional forest management.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
By definition, average baseline carbon stocks implies that there are forested properties within assessment areas that are at or slightly below baseline levels. Where these areas intersect with moderate to high forest productivity, and economic constraints such as distance to markets, that make traditional forest management less profitable, there is opportunity for landowners to explore alternative sources of revenue. Our goal is to create a nation-wide map of these areas to help inform where forest managers should prioritize carbon sequestration versus more traditional forest management. TCT will use these maps in tandem with local consulting foresters to conduct focused landowner outreach and education about emerging opportunities to participate in ecosystem service markets. Our ultimate goal is to provide upfront financial incentives to landowners with substantial sequestration potential and encourage new market participants.
