### Spatial Analysis Project: 

Our project is based on crowdsourcing and open data as a way to support development in rural Tanzania, particularly to reduce gender inequality, prevent gender-based violence, and improve education and health. The project is run by volunteers with no GIS experience, but we realize the power of maps in tackling big problems and wish to expand our reach.

We have the following location-based data available: population density and poverty levels, incidences of female genital mutilation (FGM) and child marriage, educational achievement and various health aspects. We would like to generate maps to visualize regions or places that have the most immediate needs, allowing us to dedicate our resources to specific places & problems. For example, we are working to reduce the incidence of FGM by manually mapping incidents, and then improving maps of nearby regions on OpenStreetMap to support outreach work in poorly accessible areas & previously unknown settlements.
