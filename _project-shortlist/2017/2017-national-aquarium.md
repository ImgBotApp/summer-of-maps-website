## Spatial Analysis Project:
This project will demonstrate the effectiveness of legislation aimed at reducing marine debris. Each year in all levels of politics, multiple pieces of legislation are introduced with the hope of reducing certain types of waste at their source. Though countless studies have shown the negative effect of marine debris on our environment, these types of legislation are met with resistance and are rarely passed. Through this project, we hope to provide valuable data analysis for supporters of these types of legislation. By examining the amount of marine debris found in different areas of the United States relative to legislation that has been implemented to reduce it, we can show the effectiveness of these important measures. We also hope to look at the composition of marine debris in our region to get a better idea of what is there, and the best way to address and reduce it.

#### Data available:
The National Aquarium is the state coordinator for all International Coastal Cleanup (ICC) events in Maryland. The ICC, organized by Ocean Conservancy, has the largest collection of item-specific marine debris data available over time displayed in their Ocean Trash Index. This incredible database can provide marine debris data down to the number of each type of marine debris removed during cleanups for the entire world.

Similarly, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tracks marine debris items removed through its Marine Debris Tracker program.

We have strong partnerships with both organizations to utilize the data for this project. Statewide and regional marine debris data bases will also be incorporated. Our political experts on staff can assist with gathering the data about current legislation. Maps from the EPA, Maryland DNRâ€™s Coastal Atlas and the Chesapeake Bay Program can provide regional land use data.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
As a result of this project, we would like to see a U.S. map created that compares the different types of legislation regarding marine debris versus the decrease in targeted debris removed from relevant areas over time. This may be displayed on one map with multiple layers, or in two separate maps. We would also like a regional map focused on the Chesapeake Bay watershed showing the highest concentrations of marine debris with details by item, and how that compares to the surrounding land use. A brief analysis regarding the findings of this data should accompany the maps created.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The maps and reports generated from this project will assist legislators and environmental organizations in advocating for legislation that will reduce marine debris at its source. Showing these maps will create a stronger case for marine debris legislation, providing evidence of positive impacts created in areas that already have legislation in place. We know that many of our partners will be interested in using this data to create targeted outreach programs or behavior change campaigns addressing the most common types of marine debris. The map created will provide a clear view of the areas that are most in-need of marine debris outreach. In addition, many organizations including the National Aquarium apply for grant opportunities to fund marine debris removal and outreach activities, and the information from this project will strengthen grant proposals using the data to support related requests.
