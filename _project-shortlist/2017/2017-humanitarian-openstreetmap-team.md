## Spatial Analysis Project:
Visualize the impact HOT’s projects have on the people participating in them, the people living there, and to encourage further use of the enormous amount of data collected as part of some of HOT's projects: "Ramani Huria" project in Dar es Salaam, “Mapping Financial Inclusion” in Uganda, and InAware in Indonesia. HOT proposes to develop geospatial analyses and thematic maps to evaluate, visualize and translate geodata for these areas and relate this to personal stories from students, team members and participants on our projects, and their relation to the Sustainable Development Goals.

These stories and maps could be used to showcase how open geospatial data (OpenStreetMap) can both affects people’s lives directly, and at the same time be used to measure and assess progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (focusing on selected goals, targets and indicators; specific attention to those where the disaggregated/granular nature of OSM data offers additional insights).

#### Data available:
All of the data HOT collects is already available as open data on OpenStreetMap. We will provide participants with a full data model, and a snapshot of the OpenStreetMap data (in a preferred format, shapefiles possible) for each project/story we’d like to include.

For example, the data (according to a granular defined data model) that is available for Dar es Salaam, Tanzania via OpenStreetMap, contains data on at least the following:
- Buildings, including (where available) street names and house numbers, often also building materials, number of stories, and primary use (residential, commercial, etc)
- Roads, including information on topology, surface, and often width and condition.
- Amenities, such as schools, health facilities, etc.
- Water and drainage systems

Other work that can be used as input:
- [Thematic maps on drainage](https://api.mapbox.com/v4/hot.683fcd43/page.html?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiaG90IiwiYSI6IlBtUmNiR1kifQ.dCS1Eu9DIRNZGktc24IwtA#15/-6.8061/39.2419)
- [Health and sanitation](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/innocentmaholi/ciybn6e9800412qmkwznirn0k.html?title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiaW5ub2NlbnRtYWhvbGkiLCJhIjoiY2lmcDRwdmdtNWptYXN2a3FleXdpeGZkNCJ9.nSqnxOxnlA9r-gFuA6U5SA#13.13/-6.7912/39.2437)

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
Several (3 to 7) stories/maps/analyses that translate specific types of OSM data collected for some of our projects to specific SDG goals, targets and indicators.

For example, these could be a story on flooding and urban planning (SDG 11), education (SDG 4), or on health and Sanitation (SDG 3, 6)

Ideally, these would include a web map, which allows for filtering/drill down to a specific SDG, target and indicator, a specific narrative per analysis, the ability to generate static maps on the basis of exported datasets, and the ability to compare datasets for different timeframes (to allow for visualizing/measuring data and change on specific goals/targets/indicators).

A description of the process of arriving at these maps and analyses, including the translations and transformations performed, and a replicable method for performing these on OSM datasets for other areas.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
The deliverables for the Summer of Maps would be a key part of both several of HOT's current initiatives, visualizing outputs of our projects, and would help greatly in raising the potential impact of these projects. Additionally, they would be incredibly helpful in establishing a better public understanding of the different parts of HOT's operations are integrated and reinforce each other, such as remote mapping with the global volunteer community on the one hand, and ground survey and mapping projects with local volunteers and partners on the other hand.
