## Spatial Analysis Project:
The primary purpose of our spatial analysis project is to determine the highest need areas in which to offer free literacy and computer educational programming to adults in Dane County that struggle with literacy. Through the proposed spatial analysis project, we would like to identify the following:

- Areas in Dane County that have a high proportion of adults living in poverty that do not currently have convenient access to free educational programming.
- Within these areas of high need (poverty), which neighborhoods have the highest unemployment rates and the lowest level of educational attainment?
- Within the neighborhoods determined as highest need, considering the factors listed above, which neighborhoods have the most limited access to transportation and what community building in the neighborhood is most convenient for free literacy and computer programming?

#### Data available:
Literacy Network has the following data sets to use for this project:
- Background information (addresses, employment, income and education history) on current Adult Basic Education students.
- List of current sites

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
We would like the following Dane County maps:
- Neighborhoods that have the highest rates of poverty and least access to free adult educational programming.
- Neighborhoods that have the highest number of minority adults.
- Neighborhoods that have the highest unemployment rates.
- Neighborhoods that have the lowest levels of educational attainment.
- Neighborhoods that have limited access to transportation, highlighting those neighborhoods with community centers.

We would like to overlay these maps to identify the highest need neighborhoods.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
We will use the maps to determine the best sites for our free adult literacy programs, considering the highest need neighborhoods, with regard to poverty, education, unemployment and access to transportation. Within those neighborhoods, we'll focus on areas with a community center but with limited access to educational programming.
We'll identify the areas of highest need and compile information for staff at targeted community centers. We would use information from the maps in funding proposals.
