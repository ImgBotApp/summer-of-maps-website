## Spatial Analysis Project:
William Way serves as the gateway for LGBT and allied community members throughout the region. Mapping both current organizational stakeholders and the broader community will help the Center's planners to understand how best to target services, marketing, and fundraising efforts. In addition, demographic analysis both of current and potential stakeholders will help us better understand the communities we serve.

We would employ American Community Survey and Census data in tandem with William Way’s data to create a series of maps of likely donors, attendees, and volunteers, as well as the census tracts in which they are located. We’d also review distribution of same-sex couples over the past decade. Finally, we would look at HIV/AIDS data collected by the Philadelphia Department of Health to identify areas where MSM (men who have sex with men) who have been tested HIV positive live as an indicator of potentially less visible community members.

#### Data available:
William Way maintains a database of donors, volunteers and program participants on its Salesforce CRM. These data are easily accessible. We would also would download a number of demographic layers from the American Community Survey, including: median household income, median age, predominant race, mode of travel to work, same sex households, etc. Finally, we would look at similar demographic variables from the City of Philadelphia's HIV/AIDS data. Additional OpenDataPhilly data may prove useful.

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
The SOM fellow would compile and present this information to respond to questions in the WWCC strategic plan. The collected demographic data would also be “stamped” onto the individual records in Salesforce so William Way would have a better idea of stakeholders' economic characteristics. Finally, maps would be created to compare actual residence of WWCC stakeholders compared to places where LGBT people as a whole are likely to live.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
William Way is in the final stage of completion of its three year strategic plan. These maps and reports would be incorporated into the plan. The SOM intern would also present her/his data to the Board of Directors and explain their import. Maps and reports will be available on the Center's website. The Executive Director will work with the intern to create a TED-talk type video to explain and disseminate the data and reports.
