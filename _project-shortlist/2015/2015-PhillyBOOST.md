## Spatial Analysis Project:
This spatial analysis project will help us determine in much greater detail where Out of School (OST) programs are offered by various networks (such as city funded CBO's, Parks and Rec. and Free Library of Philadelphia). It will help us discern visually which neighborhoods have fewer OST programs, as well as where such resources are plentiful. The project will clearly show various available programs broken down by zip code, district and CUAs. It will utilize census and other open source data (like “Open Data Philly”) to determine the demand and supply of such programs. By juxtaposing such openly available data sets as juvenile crime data with that of the OST data we can further reinforce how such programs are contributing towards the safety of youth by keeping them engaged in programs that offer a safe environment and a multitude of enriching activities.

#### Data available:
We have the following data sets available:
- participant demographics
- enrollment data
- attendance data
- agency and site location where OST services are provided

For comparison purposes we will need to utilize publicly available data through US Census (for youth population within various neighborhoods of Philadelphia) and Open Data Philly (for crime data).

#### Maps and Reports that will be created:
- Programs in various neighborhoods broken down by Districts, CUA's and Zip Codes and clearly identifying the distinct networks.
- Locations from where students commute to access OST programs. They will include the school locations to help us visually see if their choice of OST programs is influenced by the schools they attend.
- Demographic profile (including income level) of each neighborhood and availability of OST programs.
- Youth population, neighborhood crime and proximity to OST programs.

#### How the maps and reports will be used:
We intend to use them in the following ways:
- Make them available on our website for our different audiences.
- Provide them to various stakeholders (city policy makers, agency ED’s etc. funders) as part of the reports that we produce on regular basis.
- Use these reports/maps to identify under-served areas.
- Help us (visually) identify areas where various networks can collaborate by sharing the available resources.
